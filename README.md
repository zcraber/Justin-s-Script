# Justin's Script
Justin's Script is a simple handwriting-style font I've designed based on the handwriting style of my cousin in an attempt to learn the font designing basics. It contains basic Latin glyphs.

Glyphs were written on paper first. Later it was <a href="https://github.com/zcraber/Justins-Script/blob/main/Scan.pdf">scanned</a> and traced into a vector using Inkscape. Corrected each glyph using Affinity Designer and imported them individually into FontForge to generate the final font version.
