Justin's Script is a simple handwriting-style font I've designed based on the handwriting of my cousin in an attempt to learn the font designing basics. It contains basic Latin glyphs.

Glyphs were written on paper first. Later it was <a href="https://github.com/zcraber/Justins-Script/blob/main/Scan.pdf">scanned</a> and traced into a vector using Inkscape. Corrected each glyph using Affinity Designer and imported them individually into FontForge to generate the final font version.

This is a 100% IMPERFECT font! 😄 But feel free to use it for any purpose. And if possible, <a href="https://github.com/zcraber/Justins-Script/discussions">comment</a> a link to your work using this font. I'd love to see it. 😊

Thank you.
