# Justin's Script
Justin's Script is a simple handwriting-style font I've designed based on the handwriting style of my cousin in an attempt to learn the font designing basics. It contains basic Latin glyphs.

Glyphs were written on paper first. Later it was scanned and traced into a vector using Inkscape. Corrected each glyph and imported it to Fontforge to generate the final version.
